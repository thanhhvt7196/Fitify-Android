    <string name="breathwork_restful_dreams_long_description">This sleep-inducing breathing exercise helps you relax and drift into restorative sleep full of peaceful dreams by holding your breath on the inhale and lengthening the exhale.
Lie on your back, relax your full body, and place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly.
Holding the breath on the inhale and extending the exhale boosts vagal tone, quieting your body\'s stress response and activating the soothing parasympathetic nervous system. This promotes a lasting state of calm and relaxation throughout the night.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_total_recovery_long_description">This exercise helps relieve pain in your body while improving blood oxygen levels and circulation. It is effective for recovery from exercise, headaches, hangovers, muscle aches, and more.
Take slow breaths into your lower abdomen, allowing your abdomen to expand on the inhale and contract on the exhale. Keep your chest and shoulders as still as possible while breathing.
Deep breathing with intention calms and regulates the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Holding your breath slowly increases CO2 levels in the blood, which enhances the calming effect of the vagus nerve when you exhale and activates your parasympathetic system. This promotes relaxation of the mind and alleviates pain in the body. Increased CO2 levels also assist in the release of oxygen within your cells, aiding in recovery.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_congrats_screen_title">Breathing finished!</string>
    <string name="breathwork_flow_long_description">This breathing exercise focuses on alternating nostril breathing to enhance concentration, awareness, and lung function. It\'s particularly beneficial when you need to sustain your focus for extended periods.
Use your index finger or thumb to fully close either your left or right nostril. Switch nostrils with each exhale, alternating the one you inhale from.
This exercise activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which reduces stress and blood pressure while boosting awareness and respiratory endurance. It also helps harmonize oxygen levels in each nasal cavity, promoting greater clarity of mind.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_calm_long_description">This exercise is specifically crafted to alleviate stress, bring tranquility to the mind, and lower heart rate and blood pressure.
Find a comfortable position, whether sitting or lying down, with proper back support and a fairly straight spine. Focus on breathing with the diaphragm, expanding the base of your ribs and belly during inhalation, and contracting them back in during exhalation.
Engaging in slow and controlled diaphragmatic breathing, particularly with a longer exhale, activates the body\'s innate relaxation response. This promotes a sense of calmness and relaxation in both the mind and body.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_balanced_mind_long_description">This exercise is specifically designed to harmonize your mind, body, and spirit, promoting a sense of balance and well-being.
Take slow breaths into your lower abdomen during inhalation, allowing your abdomen to expand, and contract it during exhalation. Focus on keeping your chest and shoulders still as you breathe.
Breathing at a rate of 6 breaths per minute has been found to have numerous benefits, such as reducing stress, preventing insomnia, enhancing emotional control, and improving attention. Interestingly, individuals in the best health around the world naturally breathe at this rhythm.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_relief_long_description">This simple breathing technique serves as an excellent method to reset your mind, especially after a long workday or encountering stressful events that may have left your mind overwhelmed with anxiety and racing thoughts.
Breathing at this slower rate is shown to reduce anxiety, reduce negative moods, and increase subjective feelings of energy. This breathing rate has also been shown to increase alpha brain wave activity, which is associated with a relaxed, focused state and the clearing of undesirable thoughts. This type of breathing reduces stress levels and improves energy and overall mood.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_inner_peace_long_description">Inner Peace is specifically designed to assist during episodes of high anxiety. It brings a sense of relaxation to the mind while reducing heart rate and blood pressure.
Take slow breaths, directing the air into your lower abdomen as you inhale. Allow your abdomen to expand on the inhale and contract on the exhale. Keep your chest and shoulders as still as possible during the breaths.
Engaging in deliberate and gentle diaphragmatic breathing, particularly with a prolonged exhale, activates the body\'s natural relaxation response. This triggers the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure and a calming effect on the mind. Additionally, this exercise helps increase oxygen levels in the blood, which can be depleted during times of stress and anxiety.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_progressive_relaxation_long_description">Progressive Relaxation is designed to activate your parasympathetic nervous system and swiftly induce a deep state of relaxation. By maintaining a consistent inhale and gradually extending the exhale, you can improve both your mental and physical well-being.
Sit with a straight back and rest your hands on your knees or thighs. Relax your shoulders and focus on deep abdominal breathing, minimizing movement in your chest and shoulders. Keep in mind that the inhale may naturally feel quicker and less controlled during the exercise.
This exercise engages the parasympathetic nervous system, triggering the \"relaxation response\" gradually. It is beneficial after meals, for facilitating sleep, or whenever you need rapid relaxation. Studies have shown its positive effects on blood sugar levels after an oral glucose tolerance test in non-diabetic individuals (J Altern Complement Med. 2013). It is believed to improve insulin sensitivity. Moreover, the progressive extension of the exhale helps build your body\'s tolerance to carbon dioxide in an easily achievable manner.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_comfort_long_description">This powerful breathing exercise is effective for relieving anxiety, tension, and pain and can be used during moments of anxiety or panic, illness, or muscle tightness.
Visualize air moving smoothly from your nose to your throat, chest, and abdomen. Breathe deeply, allowing your abdomen to expand on the inhale and contract on the exhale.
By activating your parasympathetic nervous system, this exercise slows your heart rate, reduces blood pressure, and brings calmness to the mind. Focusing on your breath helps redirect your thoughts away from stress, worry, pain, and anger. Many therapists teach this exercise to their patients who struggle with anxiety.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_letting_go_long_description">This exercise aims to refresh your mind, alleviate stress, and decrease heart rate and blood pressure, making it ideal for unwinding after a long day or preparing for sleep.
Rest your hands on the sides of your lower ribs and gently push them outward during inhalation, then bring them back in towards your spine as you exhale. This technique deepens your breath and activates the diaphragm.
Engaging in slow and controlled diaphragmatic breathing, especially with a longer exhale, activates the body\'s innate relaxation response by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_deep_sleep_long_description">This exercise was created by Dr. Andrew Weil to help his patients relax and fall asleep more easily. It is also known as a \"natural tranquilizer for the nervous system\".
Before you start, make sure to empty your lungs of all air. You can perform this exercise either by lying flat or sitting up straight. Take slow breaths, inhaling into your lower abdomen and exhaling through pursed lips, producing a \'woosh\' sound.
Slow, rhythmic, diaphragmatic breathing can help release muscle tension, lower the heart rate, and calm the mind by activating the parasympathetic nervous system. This can make it easier to fall asleep and get a more restful night\'s sleep.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_rise_long_description">This quick and energizing exercise is designed to instantly boost your alertness, energy levels, and oxygen intake. It\'s perfect for waking up in the morning or whenever you need a quick pick-me-up.
Sit upright and breathe slowly into your lower abdomen while keeping your chest and shoulders still.
This exercise enhances adrenaline levels and increases blood alkalinity. By activating your body\'s fight or flight response through the sympathetic nervous system, it heightens alertness, concentration, and energy.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_hyper_energy_long_description">This exercise instantly increases your energy, uplifts your mood, raises blood oxygen levels, and sharpens your focus, preparing you to tackle life\'s challenges. With regular practice, it can enhance endurance and reduce daily fatigue.
Place a hand just below your belly button to breathe into your lower abdomen. Inhale to make your abdomen rise, and exhale to make it fall. Proper breathing occurs when your chest and upper body remain still while only your abdomen moves. After the 20 hyperventilations, remember to exhale fully before the 30-second breath hold.
This exercise stimulates the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline through your endocrine system, making your body alert and awake. The 20 hyperventilations increase oxygen in your blood while removing CO2, responsible for delivering oxygen to your cells. The subsequent breath hold is vital as it allows CO2 to accumulate in your blood, enabling the newly acquired oxygen to enter your cells. Additionally, it boosts the production of erythropoietin (EPO), promoting the generation of red blood cells. This enhances oxygen absorption, improves endurance, and reduces fatigue.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_box_breathing_long_description">This exercise, popularly known as box breathing, is renowned for its utilization by Navy SEALs to cultivate a serene and focused mindset, accompanied by a balanced and energized physical state. It greatly enhances concentration, balance, energy, and overall performance.
Inhale slowly, directing your breath into your lower abdomen. Allow your abdomen to expand on the inhale and contract on the exhale. Aim to keep your chest and shoulders as still as possible while you breathe.
Purposeful deep breathing has a calming effect on the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The deliberate breath-holding during this exercise allows carbon dioxide (CO2) to accumulate in the blood. Elevated levels of blood CO2 enhance the cardio-inhibitory response of the vagus nerve during exhalation, stimulating the parasympathetic system. This induces a sense of calm and relaxation in both the mind and body. Moreover, increased CO2 levels aid in the release of oxygen within your cells.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_breath_of_fire_long_description">This breathing technique is designed to swiftly activate and alert your senses. Breath of Fire involves a rapid-paced exhale and a relaxed inhale, both of equal duration, to get you up and moving.
Place one hand on your belly and imagine \"pumping\" the breath from that area during the exhale. As you exhale, gently draw your navel towards your spine, and on the inhale, release and relax the navel outward. This pumping action engages the diaphragm as you direct your breath through your nose.
This practice can optimize performance and enhance reaction times. It operates by improving the processing capabilities of the central nervous system, potentially leading to increased arousal, quicker information processing, and enhanced concentration. It can be beneficial in situations that require rapid responsiveness, such as sports, performances, and other crucial tasks.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_hype_up_long_description">This exercise, also known as box breathing, is well-known for its use by Navy SEALs to promote a calm and focused mind while achieving a balanced and energized physical state. It effectively enhances concentration, balance, energy, and overall performance.
Inhale slowly, directing your breath into your lower abdomen. Allow your abdomen to expand during the inhale and contract during the exhale. Try to keep your chest and shoulders as still as possible while breathing.
Purposeful deep breathing has a calming and regulating effect on the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The deliberate breath-holding during this exercise allows carbon dioxide (CO2) to accumulate in the blood. Elevated levels of CO2 enhance the cardio-inhibitory response of the vagus nerve during exhalation, which stimulates the parasympathetic system. This results in a calm and relaxed state of mind and body. Increased CO2 levels also aid in the release of oxygen in your cells, further promoting a sense of well-being.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_ecstasy_long_description">This exercise aims to elevate your mood, invigorate your body, and boost blood oxygen levels. It\'s perfect for those moments when you need a little pick-me-up.
You can try placing a hand on your belly and chest to feel your breathing pattern. This exercise can be done while sitting or lying down.
This exercise enhances adrenaline levels and promotes blood alkalinity. It triggers your body\'s innate fight or flight response, activating the sympathetic nervous system. This leads to heightened alertness, improved concentration, and increased energy.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_reset_long_description">This breathing exercise is designed to help restore a normal breathing pattern, bringing harmony and balance to your body. It focuses on a rhythmic pattern of inhaling for 4 seconds and exhaling for 4 seconds, promoting a sense of balance and well-being.
Find a comfortable position, whether sitting or lying down and begin by consciously inhaling deeply for a count of 4 seconds. Allow your breath to fill your lungs completely. Then, exhale gently for another 4-second count, releasing any tension or stress with each breath. Repeat this pattern, maintaining a steady rhythm.
The exercise assists in resetting your breathing to a more natural and harmonious pattern. Practicing a consistent inhale and exhale duration of 4 seconds regulates your respiratory system and promotes relaxation.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_refresh_long_description">This exercise, also known as box breathing, is famously used by the Navy SEALs to create a calm and focused mind with a balanced and energized physical state. Great for increasing concentration, balance, energy, and performance.
Breathe slowly into your lower abdomen on the inhale. Your abdomen should expand on the inhale and contract on the exhale. Try keeping your chest and shoulders as still as possible while you breathe.
Intentional deep breathing calms and regulates the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The slow holding of breath allows CO2 to build up in the blood. An increased blood CO2 level enhances the cardio-inhibitory response of the vagus nerve when you exhale and stimulates your parasympathetic system. This produces a calm and relaxed feeling in the mind and body. Increased levels of CO2 also help facilitate the release of oxygen in your cells.</string>
    <string name="breathwork_okinaga_long_description">This Japanese breathing technique involves an extended inhale and exhale. It helps suppress the stress response and allows individuals to manage their anxiety. In feudal Japan, ninjas mastered this technique to maintain a calm state during covert missions.
As you exhale, gently rock forward, and as you inhale, rock back. Imagine the breath flowing through your abdomen.
Okinaga breathing has been found to suppress the activity of the left amygdala, which plays a role in anxiety. This may provide individuals with the ability to control their anxiety levels and alleviate stress and fear responses.</string>
